# PasswordGen
Software for creating a strong passwords easily with easy to understand settings. Save the password to a file or retrieve it from the file.

Software contains four checkboxes which you can choose what your password is going to consist of. It also has a slider for adjusting the lenght of the password.
This project was created during my computer science programming 2 course trying out different skillsets I have learnt hence this was also made without JavaFX.
